#### JPA CRUD Project



### Description Overview

With this project the main task was to implement CRUD more efficiently than we have before. Much like the previous group project, our end goal was to build a website, back end and front end from scratch. This would require us to setup three major aspects of the project. The first task I choose to take was map out all the JSP pages I wanted to display. The forms, result pages, login information, style sheets, including css and bootstrap. With my JSP pages outlined(with no content but names) I was able to build out my DAO interface and my class to implement it. Within this class I used my java logic, along with my newly learned entity Manager and spring magic to come up with multiple methods to do the following: find a summit by keyword or id, add a new summit to the database, delete a summit from the database and also be able to update/edit a current existing database entry. I used a J unit test to make sure my SQL query was working properly and passed. Once I knew my logic was sound and working, I moved onto my controllers and began working on my GET and POST methods. With these built I was able to route my impl methods to my jsp pages to display my information I was pulling from my database. I used multiple controllers to get certain information like Id's and keywords, and posted new infomration, and edits/deletes.

### What I learned

- I found this project to be quite fun. It helped me not only solidify aspects I was having issues with prior to the start of this. I have had great trouble with CSS and styling. This allowed me to go extra on the stretch goals and learn more about CSS and a ton of Bootstrap in order to get certain functions working. I cant wait to learned about javascript and what I can do with it. While I spent a lot of time creating multiple custom nav bars to make it exactly as I wanted, I wish I had more time than 2 days to finish this project.
Doing this project I was able to learn a great more on exactly how paths function, as I had a lot of small errors. Some were fast and easy to fix and others took some time, but were fixable as I tracked the path of the issue to the roof of the problem. I think I learned a lot regard errors and how to handle them on the front and back end. Full stack dev is really starting to make more sense, and it seems as though the possible routes I can take will be endless. I know to this day even though we are past Java I still need to stay on top of my Java logic. I had some trouble with simple logic and how to implement what exactly I wanted done. Once I was able to achieve what I wanted accomplished, I stood back and realized how simple it was. I look forward to working with a team on the midterms and making the best possible project I can do.
